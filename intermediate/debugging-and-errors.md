# Debugging and Errors

- ReferenceError → Raised when an invalid reference is used (e.g., referencing an undefined variable, typo in variable name)
- SyntaxError → Raised when a syntax error occurs while parsing JavaScript code (e.g., missing curly brackets)
- TypeError → Raised when the type of a variable is not expected (e.g., passing in a Number instead of a String, trying to call an array method on a data type that is not an array)
